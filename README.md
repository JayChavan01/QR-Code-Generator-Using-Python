# QR-Code-Generator-Using-Python

**Overview:**  
This project is a **Python-based QR Code generator tool** that allows users to generate QR codes from any input text or URL. The generated QR code can be saved to the local device, and the tool provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. The project focuses purely on **Python programming**.

### **Key Features & Functionalities:**  

1. **QR Code Generation:**  
   - Generates a QR code from user input, which could be a URL, text, or any other form of data.  

2. **Save Generated QR Code:**  
   - After generating the QR code, the user can click the "Save" button to save the QR code image to the local device.  

3. **User Input Handling:**  
   - Accepts input from users (URL or text) for QR code generation.  
   - Provides a simple interface to preview the generated QR code before saving.  

4. **Exit Functionality:**  
   - Provides an "Exit" button that closes the application.

### **Tools & Technologies Used:**  
- **Python** (for scripting and automation)  
- **Tkinter** (for creating the GUI)  
- **qrcode** (for generating QR codes)  
- **Pillow** (for saving and manipulating images)

### **Functionality Overview:**

- **Create Button:**  
   - Takes the user input (text or URL) and generates a QR code.  

- **Save Button:**  
   - Saves the generated QR code as an image (usually in PNG format) on the local device.  

- **Exit Button:**  
   - Exits the application, closing the window.
